[[Enter the story world.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Enter the story world." tags="" position="412,939" size="100,100">//Unlike most romantic stories, their beginning did not begin on a sunny day. 

It was storming badly in Gladik, around 5pm Eastern Standard time. The news had broadcasted that it was recommended for people to stay indoors for the rest of the week as the damaging winds raged beyond control. 

While most families were safe and sound in their homes as they sat this storm out, a man was desperate to go to his local supermarket to retrieve his dog some food for the next week. He had grown use to storms and thought that he could tough it out, the shop clerk that met him at the checkout thought he was crazy. 

She was around his age, and although it was a small town, they hadn’t crossed paths before...He would remember her. “You’re either brave or crazy for coming out in this weather.” She said, with a hint of an accent as she checked out his items. “Well, what about you? Shouldn’t you be home too?” He asked as he paid for his things. 

“I guess I’m crazy too.” 

Smiling just as a strike of thunder hit a nearby electricity box. The whole town was enveloped in darkness, with the only sound being the ghastly winds and heavy downpour. 
The only light in the store that shone was the glow of the battery-operated speaker and the screens of their mobile phones as they held it in hopes to make out anything. “Shit, I think my boss keeps torches somewhere around here. Do you mind getting some matches and candles down aisle 9?” 

He was shocked. Here she was in the dark, alone in a store during a thunderstorm with a Stranger and she didn’t care. “Aren’t you scared?” He asked. She laughed and walked away without an answer. He stared at her back until he couldn’t make out her silhouette anymore and quickly rushed down the aisle to grab the supplies.// [[Come back]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Come back" tags="" position="412,1089" size="100,100">“She was crazy.” He whispered with a soft chuckle. 

I would’ve missed the soft noise had it not been for the new-found smile on his face as he angled himself to face me more in his chair. 

“She sure sounds a bit crazy, I agree.” I caught sight of the nurse outside of Henry&#39;s door and she held up a tray of food. 
[[She knocks.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="She knocks." tags="" position="412,1239" size="100,100">“Henry, it is now time for lunch, okay let’s take a break from reading to eat and drink something.” I waved in the nurse and stood from my space to give her a place to sit while she went through introducing herself. 

[[“I want to hear the story.”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="“I want to hear the story.”" tags="" position="412,1389" size="100,100">Henry said as he looked away from his caregiver.

She turned to him at his request and smiled fondly. “Henry, these are your favourite foods that you love for lunch. You want to eat them while they’re fresh, don’t you?” 

As if he had just noticed her in the room he turns to her and freezes. She smiles softly at him and guides his hands to his cutlery. [[His eyes meet mine]] over her silhouette in question.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="His eyes meet mine" tags="" position="412,1539" size="100,100">I smile, “Don’t worry Henry, I’ll still be here to continue the story when you finish eating. Let me just get a drink while you eat and then I’ll continue.” 

Henry nodded and went to eating his food the nurse had given him, his eating routine had never altered. He still enjoyed having each staple food separated. His meat sectioned from his rice, which was then separated from his vegetables. Drinking my glass of water, I observed the garden thinking of [[my father.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="my father." tags="" position="412,1689" size="100,100">My father was an adventurous man. He often boasted about his adventures in his youth, telling me story after story about the main events in his life. I remember every day of my childhood was spent in the backyard with my father as he taught me how to ride a bike, kick a soccer ball, swing on a swing and envision life as a never-ending adventure. 

I remember one day my father and I laid out in our backyard for an entire day. 

Doing nothing but watching the clouds and seeing who could come up with the best image of the shape and create a new personality for the cloud. My mother would watch us from the kitchen as she cooked food or sometimes just drank a tea and observed. 

“[My two backyard warriors]” She would call us, as we came in at sunset with muddy clothes and sometimes even warrior scars. That mainly came from scraping my knees on gravel when we’d try and create a new game or play hide and seek. 
We lived and breathed playing in our backyard. But we were water children and we thrived in the rain. 

When it’d rain, my parents would put on loud music and we’d run out as a family. A water dance, my parents would call it. 

We’d hold hands spinning and laughing and lifting our arms in the air as we splashed mud onto each other.  

I wonder when it was [[our last time]] doing that. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="our last time" tags="" position="412,1839" size="100,100">“Henry has finished his lunch for today, he’s yours when you’re ready.” The nurse announces in a cherry voice. She begins to clear his plates and I notice his eyes are fixated on her hair; the light touches her blonde tips to resemble white embers. She is oblivious to his gaze of adoration. Just as she stands straight and looks at him, he turns toward me acting indifferent. 

I realise now that I have found myself pulled towards the garden, the glass touches the air between my fingertips as I longingly wish to feel the grass again. To be in that [[memory]] again. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="memory" tags="" position="412,1989" size="100,100">“A beautiful garden, isn’t it?” Henry asks me in a modest tone. 

The nurse smiles and leaves the room with a farewell to Henry and letting him know she is in the kitchen now washing dishes and will be back for dinner time. 

“It reminds me of the one I grew up in.” I say as I turn towards him, he nods and smiles. “Me too, I grew up on a farm as a boy too.” 

Now it’s my turn to smile. “Yeah? What was that like?”

I settle back into my chair, as he folds his hands in his lap and takes a breath.

He taught me that everything I needed, everything that mattered, I had. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="my father" tags="" position="412,2289" size="100,100">“He sounds like a great man. He reminds me of my own father.” I say as he stares off into the distance. 

I don’t rush to fill in the silence, I let him breathe and bask in his own memory. 

“Tell me about him [[son.]]” </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="son." tags="" position="412,2439" size="100,100">I paused, taken aback by his term of endearment and settling back into my seat more. 

“Well, he’s always taught me that my imagination is what makes me unique in the world. My vision of reality is something that will always differ from others but that it’s never a limitation but kind of like a superpower.” I paused to take a swig of water from my water bottle. 

“I think he really nurtured my creative side, as a result it made for the happiest childhood. You see, he has synaesthesia, but that never stopped him from anything, instead I think it was his own superpower.” I hadn’t looked at Henry the entire time I spoke as I thought of my father, but I felt his attentive eyes on me. 

He nodded and released a sigh, “we both have great dads.” I can see from the corner of my eyes he has the ghost of a smile on his lips.

After a few moments, I reach for the book on the desk. [[“Would you like to continue the story?”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="“Would you like to continue the story?”" tags="" position="412,2589" size="100,100">He turns to me and asks, “the story your father wrote?”

I nod, “Yeah, they’re sitting through a storm together now.” 

“Yeah, let’s continue the story... I’d like that... But I’d like some water first.” It is only then do I realise the sudden drop in his fatigue as he deflates after his memory. I want to reach out and comfort him but I don’t feel I’m in a position where I am able too. 

Is a touch of comfort suitable for our relationship? 

Instead, I reach for the glass and jug of water that was left on the desk in front of him. 

Pouring the glass through to halfway, I see both myself and Henry in the reflection. I smile. 

“Here’s your water. Would you like help or would you like to do it yourself?” I ask steadily. “I’ve got it, thanks Ethan.” 
I take a sharp intake of breath, before handing the glass to him. “No problem. [[I’ll start.]]” 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="I’ll start." tags="" position="412,2739" size="100,100">//He had gathered all the supplies he could carry while still holding his phone as a source of light. Suddenly there was a bright circle shining on the ceiling and he smiled. She was shining the torch on the ceiling like a light house beckon, telling him where she was. 

He approached the checkout register sooner than he anticipated and she sat there with a soft orange glow reflecting on her. He watched as she was checking for service on her phone. With no luck she sat down defeated. He dumped all the items on the conveyor belt. 

“Finally. Look I don’t think we’re going to be able to get out of here tonight in one piece. So, let’s set up in the break room, there’s couches in there. I’ll just lock the door first.” She met his eyes before heading towards the doors without giving him a second to process what she had just said. 

He considered his situation. It was storming outside, trees were falling and destroying their town, the windows were taking on the brute force of the wind but struggling, his dog was safe inside and had been fed and had water. He would just camp out with this girl until it was safe enough to leave or until he got enough bars of service to check the news updates. 

...Who was he kidding, he knew she had already made the decision for him and he was just trying to justify why he was letting her make all the calls for tonight. 

With this he laughed. She really was crazy.

When she had finished locking up, she made her way back to him, “Got everything?” 

“Yeah, lead the way captain.” He shuffled to carry all the candles and matches, as well as his own belongings he brought. Which was just his wallet and a jacket. He left the dog food at the counter.

They went into the break room… and fell in love. They lived happily ever after  [[the end.]]&quot;

//</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="the end." tags="" position="412,2889" size="100,100">Henry blew an exasperated huff, “Ethan, don’t get shy on me now boy. What happened next?” 

I laughed, “No they really did just fall in love after that night and live happily ever after.” 

“Let me see the book, boy.” He leaned towwards me and I passed him the book. Scanning his eyes over the words, he laughed as well. “No offence, but your dad sucks at writing books... Please, don’t tell me you write books that end like this?” 

I join him as well, “No, I don’t luckily. I like to finish my stories but I’ll make sure to let him know…[[Should we go for a walk outside?]] The sun will start to set soon and I know how much you enjoy the sunset over the hills.” 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Should we go for a walk outside?" tags="" position="412,3039" size="100,100">He looks out the window again, I recall his face as distant familiarity. “Yeah, I’d like that.” He stands up and I follow. It is only then that I take into account how his frame is slightly hunched over with age, and I’m now about a foot taller than him. 

He shuffles in his slippers towards the door. I make note to approach his closet first. “Would you like to wear a jacket; it gets cold out there fast sometimes.” He stops and turns, “yeah you’re right. I should wear a jacket, get the blue one for me, will you?” 

I grab the worn down but sturdy windbreaker, C.T is embroidered into the collar of the jacket. I slide his wardrobe door shut and follow him towards the hallway. 

The hallway is littered with art, some painted, some pictured. He’s observing the image of [[a lady dancing in the rain]] that’s plastered across the wall above the fireplace in the lounge. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="a lady dancing in the rain" tags="" position="412,3189" size="100,100">The nurse is standing in the kitchen preparing dinner and notices us. “Hello Ethan, Henry. Dinner will be ready soon and I’ll put on the fireplace once the sun is set. I know how much you like the warmth and smell Henry.” 

He doesn’t take his eyes off the image of the young lady. The image is in black and white, you can’t see her face or features, just her silhouette as she embraces the sky in a welcoming gesture. 

The nurse turns to me and gives me a pitiful smile and nod of acknowledgement. I swallow my own saliva in a gulp and gently tap Henrys shoulder, nodding towards the sliding door that leads us to the porch. “Let’s go see the sunset before we miss it.” 

He nods in a daze and follows me. Almost as if [[we are mirroring one another]] we put on our shoes and open the door and fly screen for the porch. 

The porch is a light brown, a rustic paint job. There is a cosy swing chair to our left and a bench with flowerpots littered on it. We both choose to settle onto the swing chair, sinking into pillows and blankets and draping one over both of us, we gaze over the horizon. 

It’s a vast amount of hills, like the windows screensaver. There is the garden to our left, that branches out far with flowers of all kinds. We take in the fresh spring scent, as clouds begin to flood the sky. We sit in comfort gazing at the descending sun. 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="we are mirroring one another" tags="" position="412,3339" size="100,100">“Ethan, look at that cloud. Don’t you think it looks like your mother making her famous pot pie?” He points to a joint cloud that looks obscure. 

I smile, as I choke back tears. “Yeah, it does, but what about that one? You can’t tell me it doesn’t look like grandpa’s dog.” I point at a cloud that&#39;s drooped to the side, but knew he’d get it. 

He laughs, “it really does!” 

The nurse comes out at the sound of his laughter, “Time to eat, [my two backyard warriors.]”
